# js2-refactor.el [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/magnars/js2-refactor.el.png)](http://travis-ci.org/magnars/js2-refactor.el)

A JavaScript refactoring library for emacs.

This is a collection of small refactoring functions to further the idea of a
JavaScript IDE in Emacs that started with js2-mode.

## Breaking change in 0.6.0

You now choose your own keybinding scheme. If you just want what you had
before this change, add this to your init:

    (js2r-add-keybindings-with-prefix "C-c C-m")

See **Setup keybindings** below for more.

## Installation

I highly recommend installing js2-refactor through elpa.

It's available on [melpa](http://melpa.milkbox.net/):

    M-x package-install js2-refactor

You can also install the dependencies on your own, and just dump
js2-refactor in your path somewhere:

 * js2-mode https://github.com/mooz/js2-mode/
 * dash https://github.com/magnars/dash.el
 * s https://github.com/magnars/s.el
 * multiple-cursors https://github.com/magnars/multiple-cursors.el
 * yasnippet https://github.com/capitaomorte/yasnippet

I also recommend that you get
[expand-region](https://github.com/magnars/expand-region.el) to more easily mark
vars, method calls and functions for refactorings.

Then add this to your emacs settings:

    (require 'js2-refactor)

## Setup keybindings

All functions in js2-refactor have a two-letter mnemonic shortcut. For
instance, extract-function is `ef`. You get to choose how those are bound.
Here's how:

    (js2r-add-keybindings-with-prefix "C-c C-m")
    ;; eg. extract function with `C-c C-m ef`.

If you would rather have a modifier key, instead of a prefix, do:

    (js2r-add-keybindings-with-modifier "C-s-")
    ;; eg. extract function with `C-s-e C-s-f`.

If neither of these appeal to your sense of keyboard layout aesthetics, feel free
to pick and choose your own keybindings with a smattering of:

    (define-key js2-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-e C-f") 'js2r-extract-function)

## Refactorings

 * `ef` is `extract-function`: Extracts the marked expressions out into a new named function.
 * `em` is `extract-method`: Extracts the marked expressions out into a new named method in an object literal.
 * `ip` is `introduce-parameter`: Changes the marked expression to a parameter in a local function.
 * `lp` is `localize-parameter`: Changes a parameter to a local var in a local function.
 * `eo` is `expand-object`: Converts a one line object literal to multiline.
 * `co` is `contract-object`: Converts a multiline object literal to one line.
 * `eu` is `expand-function`: Converts a one line function to multiline (expecting semicolons as statement delimiters).
 * `cu` is `contract-function`: Converts a multiline function to one line (expecting semicolons as statement delimiters).
 * `ea` is `expand-array`: Converts a one line array to multiline.
 * `ca` is `contract-array`: Converts a multiline array to one line.
 * `wi` is `wrap-buffer-in-iife`: Wraps the entire buffer in an immediately invoked function expression
 * `ig` is `inject-global-in-iife`: Creates a shortcut for a marked global by injecting it in the wrapping immediately invoked function expression
 * `ag` is `add-to-globals-annotation`: Creates a `/*global */` annotation if it is missing, and adds the var at point to it.
 * `ev` is `extract-var`: Takes a marked expression and replaces it with a var.
 * `iv` is `inline-var`: Replaces all instances of a variable with its initial value.
 * `rv` is `rename-var`: Renames the variable on point and all occurrences in its lexical scope.
 * `vt` is `var-to-this`: Changes local `var a` to be `this.a` instead.
 * `ao` is `arguments-to-object`: Replaces arguments to a function call with an object literal of named arguments.
 * `3i` is `ternary-to-if`: Converts ternary operator to if-statement.
 * `sv` is `split-var-declaration`: Splits a `var` with multiple vars declared, into several `var` statements.
 * `uw` is `unwrap`: Replaces the parent statement with the selected region.
 * `lt` is `log-this`: Adds a console.log statement for what is at point (or region).
 * `sl` is `forward-slurp`: Moves the next statement into current function, if-statement, for-loop or while-loop.
 * `ba` is `forward-barf`: Moves the last child out of current function, if-statement, for-loop or while-loop.

There are also some minor conveniences bundled:

 * `C-S-down` and `C-S-up` moves the current line up or down. If the line is an
   element in an object or array literal, it makes sure that the commas are
   still correctly placed.

## Todo

A list of some wanted improvements for the current refactorings.

 * expand- and contract-array: should work recursively with nested
   object literals and nested arrays.
 * expand- and contract-function: should deal better with nested
   object literals, array declarations, and statements terminated only
   by EOLs (without semicolons).
 * wrap-buffer-in-iife: should skip comments and namespace initializations at buffer start.
 * extract-variable: could end with a query-replace of the expression in its scope.

Thanks!

## Contribute

This project is still in its infancy, and everything isn't quite sorted out
yet. If you're eager to contribute, please add an issue here on github and we
can discuss your changes a little before diving into the elisp. :-)

To fetch the test dependencies, install
[carton](https://github.com/rejeep/carton) if you haven't already,
then:

    $ cd /path/to/expand-region
    $ carton

Run the tests with:

    $ ./run-tests.sh

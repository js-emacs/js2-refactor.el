(Given "^I have \"\\(.+\\)\"$"
       (lambda (something)

(When "^I have \"\\(.+\\)\"$"
      (lambda (something)
        ;; Do something
        ))

(Then "^I should have \"\\(.+\\)\"$"
      (lambda (something)
        ;; Do something
        ))

(And "^I have \"\\(.+\\)\"$"
     (lambda (something)
       ;; Do something
       ))

(But "^I should not have \"\\(.+\\)\"$"
     (lambda (something)
       ;; Do something
       ))
